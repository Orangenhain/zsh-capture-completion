This is a proof of concept script for capturing completion matches generated by
the zshcompsys completion system. Because of the very complicated nature of
zsh's completions, this can (to my knowledge) not be done in a straightforward
way, and this script is accordingly hacky.

Roughly, a pseudo-interactive zsh session is spawned using zpty, and a buffer
string plus a tab character is sent so the expand-word widget is executed. To
capture the hits, the compadd function is overridden, injecting a parameter
and just outputting the matching words to stdout.

Usage:

    capture.zsh bufferstring

Examples:

    capture.zsh 'vim -'
    capture.zsh 'vim --'
    capture.zsh 'vim --r'
